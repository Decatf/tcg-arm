QEMU Tiny Code Generator for Android devices

## Purpose of this library
This is a minimal build of the QEMU Tiny Code Generator (ARM architecture only). The NVIDIA Tegra 2 Cortex-A9 processor lacks the ARM NEON instruction set. QEMU TCG is used to emulate NEON instructions for Android devices without a NEON processor.
